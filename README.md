# 🚀 Edge Automation

Edge Automation is a Python-based project that leverages Selenium WebDriver to automate web searches on Microsoft Edge. It conducts randomized searches on Bing, interacts with search results, and simulates user browsing behavior for automation testing and research purposes. 🌐💡

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Microsoft Edge WebDriver** integration for seamless automation.
- 🔄 **Randomized search terms** to prevent repetitive patterns.
- 🖱️ **Simulated user actions**, including searches, link clicks, and tab switching.
- ⏳ **Dynamic waits** to optimize interaction timing.
- 🛠️ **Robust error handling** for uninterrupted execution.

## 🔧 Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:
- 🐍 **Python 3.x**
- 🌍 **Microsoft Edge WebDriver** (must be added to your system PATH)
- ⚡ **Selenium package** (`pip install selenium`)

## 🚀 Usage
Follow these steps to run the script:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KrshnK/Edge-Automation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Edge-Automation

# Run the script
python main.py
```

## 📜 How It Works
1. **Opens Bing in Microsoft Edge.** 🔎
2. **Searches for a randomized topic from a predefined list.** 🎲
3. **Clicks a randomly selected search result.** 🖱️
4. **Repeats the process across multiple tabs for diverse browsing.** 🌀
5. **Handles errors gracefully and ensures smooth execution.** ✅

## 🛠️ Customization
Modify the `search_terms` list in the script to include your own topics for automation. 📋
